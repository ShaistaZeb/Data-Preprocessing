# Telugu Language Data Preprocessing

This repository contains the code and scripts developed during my internship for preprocessing and exploratory analysis of Telugu language datasets. The goal was to clean and prepare the data for downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) tasks.

## Project Overview

- Removed null and missing values to ensure data quality.
- Identified common patterns in the text data for better handling.
- Developed scripts to automate data cleaning processes.
- Prepared datasets suitable for further NLP modeling and analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Google colab notebooks for experimentation and analysis

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required packages (listed in requirements.txt).
3. Run preprocessing scripts on raw Telugu datasets.
4. Review output cleaned data for use in NLP tasks.

## About

This project was part of an internship focused on NLP, data preprocessing, and machine learning applied to Telugu language datasets. It helped build a strong foundational understanding of data handling in linguistic AI applications.
